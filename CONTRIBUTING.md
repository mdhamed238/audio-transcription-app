## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:

1. Node.js (>= 18.x)
2. React Native development environment set up
3. Git for version control
4. A GitHub account

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/audio-transcription-app.git
   cd audio-transcription-app
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/mdhamed238/audio-transcription-app.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   ```

5. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Process

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-language-support` - For new features
- `fix/audio-recording-bug` - For bug fixes
- `docs/update-api-reference` - For documentation
- `refactor/optimize-inference` - For code refactoring
- `test/add-unit-tests` - For adding tests

### Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the conventional commits specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(transcription): add support for Spanish language

- Implement Spanish language model integration
- Add language detection for Spanish audio
- Update UI to show Spanish as an option

Closes #123
```

```
fix(audio): resolve memory leak in recording buffer

The audio recording buffer was not being properly released
after stopping recording, causing memory to accumulate.

Fixes #456
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer functional components and hooks in React

**Example:**

```typescript
/**
 * Transcribes an audio file using the ExecuTorch model
 * @param filePath - Path to the audio file
 * @param options - Transcription options
 * @returns Promise resolving to transcription result
 */
export async function transcribeAudioFile(
  filePath: string,
  options: TranscriptionOptions
): Promise<TranscriptionResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Code Style

Run linters before committing:

```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting errors
npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

### File Organization

```

â””â”€â”€ native/           # Native module interfaces
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new features
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use meaningful test descriptions

**Example:**

```typescript
describe('AudioTranscriber', () => {
  it('should start recording when startRecording is called', async () => {
    const transcriber = new AudioTranscriber(config);
    await transcriber.startRecording();
    expect(transcriber.isRecording()).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should throw error when model is not loaded', async () => {
    const transcriber = new AudioTranscriber(config);
    await expect(transcriber.transcribe()).rejects.toThrow('Model not loaded');
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e:ios
npm run test:e2e:android
```

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between modules
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
4. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark critical operations
